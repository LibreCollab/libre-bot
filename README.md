## üê≥ Quick Start with Docker

This is the recommended way to run libreBot for development and deployment.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running.
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed (usually comes with Docker Desktop).
*   A Discord Bot Token and Application Client ID (from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)).
*   A Discord Channel ID where Hetzner auction notifications should be sent.

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1.  **Clone the repository.**

2.  **Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:**
    ```env
    # Discord Bot Credentials
    DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
    CLIENT_ID=YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID_HERE
    GUILD_ID=YOUR_LIBRECOLLAB_SERVER_ID # Or your test server ID for slash command dev

    # MongoDB Credentials & Configuration
    MONGO_ROOT_USER=yourmongouser          # Choose a username for MongoDB
    MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourmongopassword  # Choose a strong password for MongoDB
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://${MONGO_ROOT_USER}:${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD}@mongo:27017/hetzner_alerts_db?authSource=admin

    # Hetzner Feature Configuration
    HETZNER_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL_ID=YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID_FOR_NOTIFICATIONS
    ```
    *   Replace placeholder values with your actual information.
    *   The `MONGODB_URI` is specifically formatted for the Docker Compose setup where `mongo` is the service name of the MongoDB container.
    *   Set `GUILD_ID` to your LibreCollab server ID for faster command propagation, or a test server ID during development.

3.  **Run up script:**
    - Before starting the bot for the first time, or whenever you add/modify command definitions, you need to register them with Discord. Run the following script from your project root `./scripts/up.sh`. This script will register the commands and do a docker compose build.

## üíª Development (Without Docker - if preferred)

1.  Install Node.js (v22+ recommended) and npm.
2.  Install MongoDB and ensure it's running.
3.  Clone the repository.
4.  Install dependencies: `npm install`.
5.  Create and configure your `.env` file (adjust `MONGODB_URI` to point to your local MongoDB instance if needed).
6.  Deploy commands: `npm run deploy`.
7.  Start the bot: `npm start`.
